    "In my undergraduate years, I chose to enrol in engineering school at University of Malaya and plan to pursue and hone my programming skills in my own terms. Hence, I was able to bring extra 'oomph' factor to complement my academic projects",
    "During my foundation studies, programming became one of my strongest subject. I became a person whom my peers refer to when they encountered programming-related problems.",
    "Back in high school, I represented my school for many competitions, including mathematical and computational olympiads. That is when I was first exposed to programming and decided I was going to do it more as a hobby.",
